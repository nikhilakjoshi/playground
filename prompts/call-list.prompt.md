Now we need to generate a new component that shows the list of calls that will be displayed on the Call list page.
Use AG grid here to display the list of calls (see image for design, columns and content.)
This too needs to be a separate component that can be lifted and shifted so have it be in one file like the call details component.
The colors for the status badges need to be the same as the ones of the call details page.
