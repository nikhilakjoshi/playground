1. I have installed the `lucide-react` package.

- Remove the folder, arrow and flag icons used from react-icons. Instead, use the lucide-react's ChevronRightIcon and FlagIcon

2. Transcript Section - Add a border bottom between each utterance entry.
3. Flag Audit log section

- By default, have all the section expanded.
- Add a white background to the container of this section as - when there are fewer entries, the grey background looks odd.
- The count of flags should be smaller in font size and lighter. Also should have a right margin before the text starts.
