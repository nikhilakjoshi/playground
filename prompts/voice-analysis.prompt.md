Create a voice-analysis component that can be lifted and shifted (self contained in one file).
This component needs to display the audio waveform of the call recording. Use the `react-voice-visualizer` package.
Check this demo link - `https://react-voice-visualizer.vercel.app/`

Use a sample audio file from the web for now.
